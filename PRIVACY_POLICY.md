# ORB BASE — PRIVACY POLICY

**Last Updated:** February 5, 2026
**Operator:** Perceptual Art LLC ("Company," "we," "us," or "our")

---

## Summary

**We collect nothing. Zero. No data leaves your device.**

ORB Base runs entirely on your local computer and local network. We do not operate servers, cloud services, or any remote infrastructure that receives data from the Software. We have designed the Software specifically to ensure your complete privacy.

---

## 1. Information We Collect

**None.**

ORB Base does not collect, transmit, store, or process any of the following:
- Personal information (name, email, address, phone number)
- Usage data or analytics
- Telemetry or diagnostics
- Crash reports
- Device identifiers
- Location data
- IP addresses
- Cookies or tracking technologies
- Chat logs or AI conversation content
- Files accessed through the gateway
- Command history
- Authentication tokens (these are generated and stored locally on YOUR device only)

## 2. How the Software Works

ORB Base operates as a local network gateway on your computer. All processing occurs on your device:

- **AI requests** are routed between your devices on your local network to locally-installed AI models (such as Ollama). These requests never pass through our servers because we do not operate servers.
- **Authentication tokens** are generated and stored locally in your home directory (`~/.orb-base/`). We never see or have access to these tokens.
- **Audit logs** are displayed in the application interface and stored only in volatile memory (RAM). They are not written to disk and are lost when the application closes.
- **Configuration settings** are stored in macOS UserDefaults on your device. We do not have access to these settings.

## 3. Third-Party Services

ORB Base does not integrate with, connect to, or transmit data to any third-party services, analytics providers, advertising networks, or cloud platforms.

The Software routes requests to locally-installed AI models (such as Ollama). These AI models are separate third-party software not provided by us. Please review the privacy policies of any AI models you install.

## 4. Data Security

Because we collect no data, there is no data to secure on our end. Your local data security depends on:
- Your device's security settings
- Your network security configuration
- Your chosen access level in ORB Base
- Your authentication token management

We recommend keeping your access level at the minimum necessary for your needs and regenerating authentication tokens periodically.

## 5. Children's Privacy

ORB Base does not collect any data from any user, including children under 13 (COPPA) or under 16 (GDPR). Because no data is collected, no special provisions for children's data are necessary.

## 6. Your Rights

### Under GDPR (EU/EEA Users)
Because we do not collect or process any personal data, the rights of access, rectification, erasure, restriction, portability, and objection under the GDPR are not applicable — there is no data to exercise these rights against. We are not a data controller or data processor with respect to your use of the Software.

### Under CCPA/CPRA (California Users)
We do not sell, share, or collect personal information. The categories of personal information described in the CCPA are not collected by us. You have the right to know what personal information is collected — the answer is none.

### Under Other Jurisdictions
Regardless of your location, our practice is the same: we collect no data. If your local law grants you data protection rights, those rights are fully respected by our zero-collection policy.

## 7. International Data Transfers

There are no international data transfers because there are no data transfers of any kind. All data remains on your local device.

## 8. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify users of any material changes by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy. Your continued use of the Software after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
