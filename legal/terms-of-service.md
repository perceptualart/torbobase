## 2. Service Description

Torbo is an AI assistant platform that provides:

- **Torbo App (iOS/iPadOS):** A mobile AI assistant with voice interaction, smart home integration, and multi-provider AI access.
- **Torbo Base (macOS/Linux):** A local network gateway that routes AI requests, manages agents, provides memory services (Library of Alexandria), and bridges to messaging platforms (Telegram, Discord, Slack, Signal, WhatsApp).
- **Cloud and Local Options:** Users may connect to cloud AI providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, xAI) using their own API keys, or run entirely local AI models via Ollama through Torbo Base. When running locally, all data stays on the user's device and network.

Torbo acts as an interface and orchestration layer. AI responses are generated by third-party models and are not directly controlled by Perceptual Art LLC.
